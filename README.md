# JavaReaperFileWriter
A class for writing reverse-engineered Reaper files.

This is very much a work in progress as of summer 2019. I only use this in one very specific way for generating Reaper projects algorithmically from audio files on the internet. This has very few options and may be buggy.

Please add to it! Open a pull request!
